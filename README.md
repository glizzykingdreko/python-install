This script, `python-install.sh`, is designed to streamline the installation of specific versions of Python on Unix-based systems such as Ubuntu, Raspberry Pi OS, and others. Whether you need to update to the latest version or install an older version, this script has got you covered.

This script is developed and maintained by Glizzy (glizzykingdreko).
